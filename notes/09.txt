Scanline Conversion
    Filling in polygons by drawing a set of lines (horizontal or vertical)
                          (x0,y0)  (x1,y1)
           T ________________ B

	   /         ___/
	  /      ___/
	 /   ___/
      M	/___/  

    1. Order points vertically
    2. Start BB
    3. (x0, y0) will always be on BM or MT
       (x1, y1) will always be on BT

    (xb,yb) --> (xb,yb)
    (xb + delta 0, yb + 1) --> (xb + delta 1, yb + 1)

    delta 1 = ?

    m(x-xb) = y-yb
    x-xb = y-yb(xt-xb / yt-yb)
    x = xb + (xt-xb / yt-yb)

    delta 0 = xm - xb / ym - yb

Objects behind objects

Z Buffering

    Keep track of z values in a separate array (z buffer)

    When plotting a pixel,
    check if its z value is greater than the current z buffer value for it

    Calculate z values for each pixel

    Initialize z buffer with smallest possible value/integer

    z is always a double

    plot(x,y,screen,color) --> plot(x,y,z,screen,color,zbuffer)

Matching real lighting

2 distinct properties
    1. Reflective properties of the object
    2. Properties of the light source - color and intensity

Lighting equation

    We need to determine a color value for each polygon

    For grayscale images we can calculate the color once per polygon
    and use that value for red, green, and blue

    For color images, we need to calculate color values separately

    I (illumination)

    I = Iambient + Idiffuse + Ispecular
    
Two kinds of light sources

    Ambient light hits all objects with the same color and intensity

    Point light sources come from a specific location, and do not hit evenly

    Ambient light
        Combination of the color of the ambient light and how much is reflected

    Diffuse reflection
    	Takes light from a single source and reflects it evenly
	in all directions
    
    Specular reflection
    	Reflects point sources at a specific vector

Reflective Properties

    % of light reflected back

    Constants of reflection (one for each R G and B)
        
        Constant of diffuse, specular, ambient

        Ks + Kd + Ka = 1

Quality of Light

    Ambient
        Represented as a color value

    Point Source
        Represented as a color value and a point
