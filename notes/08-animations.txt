    knob variable determines how much of the transformation to show

    save each frame, and then make into a gif

New commands

    vary <knob> <FO> <F!> <VO> <VI>

        vary factor 0     4           0     1
    	    	    start end frame | start end value

        delay

    frames <N>

    	set the number of frames

    basename <S>

        set the start of the filename of the frames

Pass 1
    Check for animation commands
        frames, basename, vary
	
    Check for basic animation command errors
        if frames first line of mdl file and number of frames and vary
	you can check if frame indices are in bounds

    Set number of frames

    Set basename
        if basename is not present, use some default name and alert the user
 
Pass 2
    Calculate and store knob values
    Create an array/list where each index maps to a frame
    and contains a list of knob names and values for that frame
 
    example:
        vary k  0  10  0  1
    	vary x  3   6   1  0 
 
	frames
    	0_ -> k: 0 -> x: 1
	1_ -> k: .1 -> x: 1
	2_ -> k: .2 -> x: 1
    	3_ -> k: .3 -> x: 1
    	4_ -> k: .4 -> x: .666
   	5_ -> k: .5 -> x: .333
    	6_ -> k: .6 -> x: 0 
    	7_ -> k: .7 -> x: 0
    	8_ -> k: .8 -> x: 0
    	9_ -> k: .9 -> x: 0
    	10_ -> k: 1 -> x: 0
 
Pass 3
    If no animation code was found, draw a single image 

    If there is animation code, for each frame:
        1. set all knob values in symbol table based on the list from pass 2
	2. go through the drawing commands applying knobs as needed
	3. save the image as basename + frame number
